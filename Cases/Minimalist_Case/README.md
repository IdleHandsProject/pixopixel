# A Minimalist Case for the PIXO Pixel

There is only a port for power - buttons and USB programming are covered up with this case, but it could be easily modified to make them more accessible.

This case can also be downloaded from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2974680)

## Assembly Instructions

1) Remove all hardware that came with the PIXO Pixel
2) Screw 4x M3x6 standoffs into the base of the "Case" part and secure with an M3 nut
3) Place bottom board of PIXO Pixel into case, and secure with 4x M3x15 standoffs
4) Place upper board of PIXO Pixel on standoffs
5) Place "Bezel" part on top of upper board
6) Secure with M3 screws of appropriate length (I used M3x12 button head screws)

Plug in power and enjoy!
