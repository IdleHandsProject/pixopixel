# The PIXO Pixel
PIXO Pixel is a 16 x 16 RGB LED display that runs off of an ESP32.

I have submitted a pull request to the Arduino-ESP32 github: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 to have the PIXO Pixel have its own board file. This will ensure the pinout that was used will match the pin declartion on the board. In the meantime, please use the "Adafruit Feather ESP32" in the board manager, as the pinout is the same.
